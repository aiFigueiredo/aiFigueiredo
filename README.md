### Hi there 👋

My name is José and I'm a self-taught iOS Developer from Portugal 🇵🇹

I've worked with PHP, JS, C, C++, C#, Java and Objective-C but in the last 8 years my focus has been Native iOS Development using Objective-c and more recently Swift with the ocasional Ruby and Python when needed.

#### A few fun facts about myself:

- 🏀 My favorite sport is Basketball
- 🎬 I like watching good Movies and Series
- 🎮 I enjoy PC and Console Video Games
- 🤖 I have a lot of fun and useful Home Automations in my House
- 🎧 Once upon a time I was a DJ, so I really enjoy all kinds of Music
